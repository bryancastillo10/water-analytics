## üåä Water Analytics Web App

This **TypeScript-based** web application is designed for **modern water analytics monitoring**, ensuring **scalability** and **maintainability** through well-structured software development practices. The goal is to provide an efficient and reliable solution for monitoring water data with a robust and maintainable architecture.

## 1. üíª Client Side (Frontend)

The client side of this application is built with **React and TypeScript**. Additional tools used include:

- **React-Redux** ‚Äì Global state management  
- **Redux Toolkit Query** ‚Äì API call handling  
- **Recharts** ‚Äì Interactive chart visualization  
- **TanStack React Table** ‚Äì Efficient table rendering  
- **Phosphor Icons** ‚Äì Icon library  
- **Tailwind CSS** ‚Äì Styling components and layouts  

The folder structure is organized based on **features**, with each feature containing similar subfolders such as **components**, **api**, **hooks**, and **utils**.

Meanwhile, **globally shared components and scripts** are placed in dedicated folders outside the feature-based structure. Through this structure, we can ensure modularity & maintainability of the app:

```bash

## 2. üåê Server Side (Backend)

The server side of this application is built with **Node-TS and Express**. Libraries and other tools were used to ensure efficient database management, authentication, security, and file handling:

- **Prisma ORM** ‚Äì Handle database query & communication with the server
- **MongoDB** - Scalable No-SQL Database
- **Helmet** ‚Äì Enhances security by managing HTTP headers  
- **Jsonwebtoken & Cookie-Parser** ‚Äì for secure authentication and session management  
- **Multer** ‚Äì Middleware for handling file uploads
- **Cloudinary SDK** ‚Äì Cloud-based storage bucket for image uploads 
- **Nodemailer** ‚Äì Manages email sending such as for password reset feature
